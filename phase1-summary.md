# BoardGame Beats - Phase 1 Summary

## Project Overview

BoardGame Beats is a web application that generates personalized Spotify playlists to match the atmosphere of board games. The app uses Spotify's API for authentication and playlist creation, and will eventually incorporate AI to generate tailored music recommendations.

## Phase 1 Accomplishments

### Core Infrastructure
- Set up Next.js 14 project with TypeScript
- Implemented Chakra UI for responsive, accessible design
- Created basic page structure and navigation

### Authentication
- Implemented Spotify OAuth authentication using NextAuth.js
- Set up secure environment configuration
- Fixed authentication flow issues
- Added proper error handling for authentication

### Environment Configuration
- Established proper environment variable management
- Created `.env.example` with placeholder values
- Secured sensitive information in `.env.local` (not committed to version control)
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files

### User Interface
- Created responsive landing page
- Implemented user profile page
- Added search page placeholder
- Designed playlists page structure

### Development Best Practices
- Set up proper debugging tools
- Implemented secure credential management
- Created diagnostic tools for troubleshooting

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Chakra UI
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with Spotify OAuth
- **API Integration**: Spotify Web API
- **Styling**: Chakra UI theming system

## Next Steps for Phase 2

1. Implement board game search functionality
2. Create playlist generation interface
3. Integrate with Spotify API for playlist creation
4. Develop AI-powered music recommendation system
5. Add playlist customization options
6. Implement playlist sharing functionality

## Environment Setup for Contributors

To set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
3. Fill in your Spotify API credentials in `.env.local`
4. Run `npm install`
5. Start the development server with `npm run dev`

## Authentication Flow

The application uses Spotify OAuth for authentication:

1. User clicks "Sign in with Spotify"
2. User is redirected to Spotify's authorization page
3. After authorizing, user is redirected back to the application
4. NextAuth.js handles the OAuth callback and creates a session
5. User can now access their Spotify profile and create playlists
